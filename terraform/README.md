# Terraform Directory

This directory contains the Terraform configurations for provisioning and managing your Minecraft Network infrastructure in Vultr. Before running Terraform, please follow the instructions below to ensure a successful deployment:

## Prerequisites

- Terraform: Please make sure you have Terraform installed on your system. You can download it from the [Terraform website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Configuration

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the `terraform` directory:

```bash
cd terraform
```

3. Rename the `terraform.tfvars.example` file to `terraform.tfvars`:

```bash
mv terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```

4. Open the `terraform.tfvars` file in a text editor and customize the variables according to your environment and requirements. Please update the following variables:

- `VULTR_API_KEY`: Specify your API Key for Vultr.
- `VULTR_PUBLIC_SSH_KEY`: Set this to a public key to be used as a login method on the vm.

Ensure you provide valid and appropriate values for each variable to match your specific Vultr environment.

## Deployment

Once you have updated the `terraform.tfvars` file with the required values, you can proceed to deploy your Minecraft Network infrastructure using Terraform.

1. Initialize Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

2. Review the changes that Terraform will apply:

```bash
terraform plan
```

3. If the plan looks correct, apply the changes:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Terraform will create the necessary resources as defined in the configuration files.

## Clean Up

To destroy the created infrastructure and resources, you can use the following command:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Please exercise caution with this command, as it will permanently delete the resources.
